 MuMoTrack as for "MUltiple MOtion Trackers". Simple algorithm that tracks high contrast trackers in the style of motion capture in cinema ( much less elaborate ). Can automatically track and identify N different trackers on the same videos from a small user defined 'training' set of shapes, based on shape identities. (HU moments)
